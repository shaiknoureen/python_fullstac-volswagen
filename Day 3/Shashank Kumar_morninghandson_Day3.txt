    Aspect	              	      SQL 	           		      	                     NoSQL
Data Structure		Tables with rows and columns				Document-based, key-value, column-family, or graph-based
Schema			Fixed schema (predefined structure)			Flexible schema (dynamic and adaptable)
Scalability		Vertically scalable (upgrading hardware)		Horizontally scalable (adding more servers)
Data Integrity		ACID-compliant (strong consistency)			BASE-compliant (more available, less consistent)
Query Language		SQL (Structured Query Language)				Varies (e.g., MongoDB uses its own query language)
Performance		Efficient for complex queries and transactions		Better for large-scale data and fast read/write operations
Use Case		Best for transactional systems (banking, ERP, etc.)	Ideal for big data, real-time web apps, and data lakes
Examples		MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server		MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB, Neo4j
