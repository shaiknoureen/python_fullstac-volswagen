5 differences between sql and NoSQL are following :

a. SQL databases store data in a structured table format with a fixed schema, whereas NoSQL databases store data in flexible formats such as documents, key-value pairs, or graphs.

b. SQL databases follow a predefined schema that is difficult to change, whereas NoSQL databases support a dynamic schema that is easy to modify.

c. SQL databases are mainly vertically scalable by increasing server resources, whereas NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable by adding more servers.

d. SQL databases use a standardized query language called SQL, whereas NoSQL databases do not have a single standard query language and use database-specific queries.

e. SQL databases are suitable for complex queries and transactional applications, whereas NoSQL databases are suitable for big data, real-time, and distributed systems.
