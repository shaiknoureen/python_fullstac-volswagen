Differences between SQL and NoSQL

1. Data Structure
SQL databases store data in tables with rows and columns, whereas NoSQL databases store data in collections and documents.

2. Schema
SQL databases have a fixed schema, but NoSQL databases have a flexible schema.

3. Query Language
SQL databases use SQL commands like SELECT and INSERT, while NoSQL databases use query methods such as find() and insertOne().

4. Type of Data
SQL databases are best suited for structured data, whereas NoSQL databases handle semi-structured and unstructured data efficiently.

5. Examples
Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL, while examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Firebase.


db.juices.insertMany([
  { juiceId: 1, name: "Apple Juice", price: 50, size: "Medium" },
  { juiceId: 2, name: "Orange Juice", price: 60, size: "Large" },
  { juiceId: 3, name: "Mango Juice", price: 70, size: "Medium" },
  { juiceId: 4, name: "Pineapple Juice", price: 65, size: "Small" },
  { juiceId: 5, name: "Grape Juice", price: 55, size: "Medium" },
  { juiceId: 6, name: "Watermelon Juice", price: 45, size: "Large" },
  { juiceId: 7, name: "Banana Shake", price: 80, size: "Large" },
  { juiceId: 8, name: "Strawberry Juice", price: 75, size: "Medium" },
  { juiceId: 9, name: "Mixed Fruit Juice", price: 90, size: "Large" },
  { juiceId: 10, name: "Papaya Juice", price: 50, size: "Small" }
]);


db.juices.find({ size: "Large" });
