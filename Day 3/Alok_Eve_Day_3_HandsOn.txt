Insert Operations

1. What is the purpose of insertOne() in MongoDB?
Ans. insertOne() is used to insert a single document into a collection in MongoDB. It adds one record at a time and returns an acknowledgment of success.

2. Write a MongoDB command to insert a single document into a collection.

Ans. db.students.insertOne({ name: "Alok", age: 22, course: "MCA" })
	This command inserts one document into the students collection.

3. How does MongoDB behave if the collection does not exist while using insertOne()?
Ans. If the collection does not exist, MongoDB automatically creates the collection and then inserts the document. No error is thrown.

4. What is insertMany() and how is it different from insertOne()?
Ans. insertMany() is used to insert multiple documents at once, while insertOne() inserts only one document. insertMany() improves performance when inserting bulk data.

5. What happens if one document fails during insertMany() execution?
Ans. By default, MongoDB stops inserting remaining documents when one fails (ordered insert). If ordered: false is used, MongoDB continues inserting the remaining documents.

Update Operations

1. What is the difference between updateOne() and updateMany()?
Ans. updateOne() updates only the first matching document, while updateMany() updates all documents that match the filter condition.

2. Write a command to update only one document’s field in MongoDB.

Ans. db.students.updateOne({ name: "Alok" }, { $set: { age: 23 } })
	This updates the age field of only one matching document.

3. How do you update multiple documents at the same time in MongoDB?
Ans. You use updateMany() with a filter condition. It applies the update to all documents that satisfy the condition.

4. What happens if the filter condition in updateOne() matches multiple documents?
Ans. MongoDB updates only the first matched document. The remaining matching documents are ignored.

5. What update operator is used to modify specific fields without replacing the entire document?
Ans. The $set operator is used to modify specific fields. It updates only the given fields without affecting other data.

Add Date (Current Date)

1. How do you add the current date to a document while inserting data?
Ans. You can use new Date() while inserting the document. This stores the current date and time.

2. Which MongoDB operator is equivalent to SQL CURDATE()?
Ans. new Date() or the $currentDate operator is equivalent to SQL CURDATE() in MongoDB.

3. Write a command to add the current date to all existing documents.

Ans. db.students.updateMany({}, { $currentDate: { createdAt: true } })
	This adds the current date to all documents.

4. What is the difference between using new Date() and $currentDate?
Ans. new Date() is used during insertion or manual updates, while $currentDate automatically sets the server’s current date during an update operation.

Delete Operations

1. What is the difference between deleteOne() and deleteMany()?
ans. deleteOne() removes only one matching document, while deleteMany() removes all matching documents.

2. Write a MongoDB command to delete a single document.
Ans. db.students.deleteOne({ name: "Alok" })
	This deletes only one document matching the condition.

3. What happens if the filter in deleteMany() is empty {}?
Ans. All documents in the collection are deleted. The collection structure remains intact.

Drop Operations

1. How do you drop a collection (table) in MongoDB?
Ans. db.students.drop()
	This completely removes the collection and its data.

2. What is the command to drop an entire database in MongoDB?
Ans db.dropDatabase()
	This permanently deletes the selected database.

3. What is the difference between deleteMany({}) and drop()?
Ans. deleteMany({}) removes all documents but keeps the collection, while drop() removes the entire collection including indexes and metadata.
