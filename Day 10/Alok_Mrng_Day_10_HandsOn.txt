1. Scenario-based questions on elif conditions
Online Shopping Discount
A shopping website gives:
20% discount if total amount ≥ 5000
10% discount if total amount ≥ 3000
No discount otherwise

Write a Python program using if–elif–else to calculate the final payable amount.

Ans:
amount = float(input("Enter total shopping amount: "))

if amount >= 5000:
    discount = amount * 0.20
elif amount >= 3000:
    discount = amount * 0.10
else:
    discount = 0

final_amount = amount - discount

print("Discount:", discount)
print("Final Payable Amount:", final_amount)


2. Traffic Signal System

A traffic light system works as follows:
"RED" → Stop
"YELLOW" → Get Ready
"GREEN" → Go

Write a program using elif to display the correct instruction based on the signal color entered by the user.

Ans:
signal = input("Enter traffic signal color: ").upper()

if signal == "RED":
    print("Stop")
elif signal == "YELLOW":
    print("Get Ready")
elif signal == "GREEN":
    print("Go")
else:
    print("Invalid signal color")


3. Electricity Bill Calculation
An electricity board charges:
₹1.5 per unit for first 100 units
₹2.5 per unit for next 100 units
₹4.0 per unit for units above 200
Use elif to calculate the electricity bill for given units consumed.

Ans.
units = int(input("Enter units consumed: "))

if units <= 100:
    bill = units * 1.5
elif units <= 200:
    bill = (100 * 1.5) + ((units - 100) * 2.5)
else:
    bill = (100 * 1.5) + (100 * 2.5) + ((units - 200) * 4.0)

print("Electricity Bill: ₹", bill)


4. Student Result Processing
A school decides grades based on marks:
≥ 90 → Excellent
≥ 75 → Very Good
≥ 60 → Good
≥ 40 → Pass
Below 40 → Fail
Write a program using elif to print the student’s grade.

Ans.
marks = int(input("Enter student marks: "))

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: Excellent")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade: Very Good")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("Grade: Good")
elif marks >= 40:
    print("Grade: Pass")
else:
    print("Grade: Fail")


5. Bank Account Status
A bank categorizes accounts as:
Balance ≥ 100000 → Premium
Balance ≥ 25000 → Gold
Balance ≥ 5000 → Silver
Below 5000 → Regular
Write a program using elif to display account type.

Ans.
balance = float(input("Enter account balance: "))

if balance >= 100000:
    print("Account Type: Premium")
elif balance >= 25000:
    print("Account Type: Gold")
elif balance >= 5000:
    print("Account Type: Silver")
else:
    print("Account Type: Regular")


Questions on whitespaces, indentation, and string math expressions
Whitespace & Readability
The following code runs without error:

6. Python
x=10+5*2
Rewrite it using proper whitespaces according to Python style guidelines and explain why this is preferred.
Indentation Error Analysis
What will happen when the following code is executed? Explain why.

Ans.
Corrected version of code will be :
x = 10 + 5 * 2

This Is Preferred because:
Python follows PEP 8 style guidelines.
Spaces around operators (=, +, *) improve readability.
Easier to understand and debug, especially in complex expressions.
Makes code look clean and professional.

This happens when Python code has incorrect indentation-
What Will Happen :
Python will raise an IndentationError
The program will not execute
Why This Happens:
Python uses indentation instead of braces {} to define code blocks.
All statements inside a block must be properly aligned.
Even one extra or missing space can cause an error.

7. if x > 5:
print("Greater")
How should it be corrected?
String vs Math Expression
What is the difference between the output of the following two statements?

Ans.
Corrected Code:
if x > 5:
    print("Greater")
Explanation:
Python requires indentation to define the body of an if statement.
The print() line must be indented (usually 4 spaces).
Without indentation, Python raises an IndentationError.
String vs Maths Expression :
print("10 + 5")
print(10 + 5)

Difference in Output
print("10 + 5")
Output: 10 + 5
Reason: It is a string, so Python prints it exactly as written.
print(10 + 5)
Output: 15
Reason: It is a mathematical expression, so Python evaluates it first.


8. Python
print("2 + 3 * 4")
print(2 + 3 * 4)
Explain the role of strings in math expressions.
Evaluating String Math Expression

Ans.
Role of Strings in Math Expressions:
A string is text enclosed in quotes (" " or ' ').
When a math expression is written inside quotes, Python treats it as plain text.
Python does not evaluate mathematical operations inside a string.

Math Expression (Without Quotes):
2 + 3 * 4
Python evaluates it using operator precedence:
* (multiplication) first → 3 * 4 = 12
+ next → 2 + 12 = 14

Evaluating a String Math Expression:
"2 + 3 * 4"
No, not automatically.
converts a string expression into a math expression.
It should be used carefully, as it can execute unwanted code.

9. Given:
Python
expr = "10 + 5 * 2"
a) What is the value stored in expr?
b) How can you evaluate it to get the numerical result?
c) Why should you be careful while evaluating it?

Ans.
a)expr stores a string, not a calculation.
"10 + 5 * 2"
It is plain text containing numbers and operators.

b)You can use eval() to evaluate the string as a math expression:
result = eval(expr)
print(result)
Output: 20

c)You be careful while evaluating it because :
eval() executes any Python code inside the string.
If the string comes from user input, it can run malicious code.
This can cause security risks or unintended program behavior.

10. Indentation with elif
Identify and correct the indentation error in the code below:

Python
if marks >= 60:
    print("Pass")
elif marks >= 40:
print("Conditional Pass")
else:
    print("Fail")
Explain how indentation affects the execution of elif.

Ans.
The Error is:
The print("Conditional Pass") line is not indented.
Python expects the body of elif to be indented, just like if.

Corrected code:
if marks >= 60:
    print("Pass")
elif marks >= 40:
    print("Conditional Pass")
else:
    print("Fail")
How Indentation Affects elif Execution :
Python uses indentation to define blocks of code.
The statement under if / elif must be indented to show it belongs to that condition.
If indentation is wrong:
	Python raises an IndentationError
	Program stops execution
Correct indentation ensures:
	Only the matching condition’s block executes.
	elif is checked only if the if condition is false.
