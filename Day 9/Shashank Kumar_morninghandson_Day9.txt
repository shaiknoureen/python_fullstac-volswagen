1. let vs const – Bug in Production

Answer - Why the error happens
const does not allow reassignment. If a variable is declared using const and later you try to assign a new value to it, JavaScript throws a runtime error. In a dashboard application, if the logged-in user switches accounts without reloading the page and the role needs to be updated, using const for the role variable causes an error.


const userRole = "admin";
userRole = "user"; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

Use const for values that never change and let for values that need reassignment.

const user = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Shashank"
};

let userRole = "admin";

function switchAccount(newRole) {
  userRole = newRole;
}

Use const by default and switch to let only when reassignment is required.


2. Block Scope Debugging Issue (var vs let)

Answer - Problem with var
When var is used inside a loop, it creates a single shared variable. As a result, all dynamically created buttons log the same index value (the final value of the loop).

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  button.onclick = function () {
    console.log(i); // always logs 3
  };
}

Why let fixes the issue
let is block-scoped. Each iteration of the loop creates a new binding of i, so each button retains its correct index value.

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  button.onclick = function () {
    console.log(i); // logs 0, 1, 2
  };
}

var creates one shared variable across all iterations, while let creates a new variable binding for each iteration.


3. Error Handling in API Response

Answer - Crash reason
The API sometimes returns null, but the code assumes a valid object and tries to access deep properties, causing a runtime error.

response.data.user.name; // Cannot read properties of null
Handling using try...catch
Wrapping the access in a try...catch block prevents the application from crashing and allows graceful error handling.

try {
  const name = response.data.user.name;
  console.log(name);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Invalid API response", error);
}

Safer modern approach
Optional chaining prevents errors by safely handling null or undefined values.

const name = response?.data?.user?.name ?? "Guest";

Browser debugging steps
Open DevTools, inspect the Network tab, check the API response structure, verify whether data or user is null, and log the response before accessing properties.

4. Custom Error for Business Logic

Answer - Business rule
Payment amount should never be zero or negative. A custom error can be thrown when invalid input is detected.

function processPayment(amount) {
  if (amount <= 0) {
    throw new Error("Payment amount must be greater than zero");
  }
  return "Payment successful";
}

The error is caught and a clean message is shown without breaking the application flow.

try {
  processPayment(-100);
} catch (err) {
  alert(err.message);
}

5. Generators for Large Data Processing

Answer - Problem with normal loops
Processing a very large dataset at once can be slow and memory-intensive.

logs.forEach(log => process(log));
Using a generator function
Generators yield one item at a time, allowing efficient processing.

function* logProcessor(logs) {
  for (const log of logs) {
    yield log;
  }
}

for (const log of logProcessor(hugeLogs)) {
  process(log);
}

Generators are better because they reduce memory usage, process data lazily, and are ideal for large datasets, logs, and streams.

6. Iterators in a Custom Object

Answer - Enable iteration over a custom object using for...of.
Implementation using Symbol.iterator
const playlist = {
  songs: ["Song A", "Song B", "Song C"],
  [Symbol.iterator]() {
    let index = 0;
    return {
      next: () => {
        if (index < this.songs.length) {
          return { value: this.songs[index++], done: false };
        }
        return { done: true };
      }
    };
  }
};

for (const song of playlist) {
  console.log(song);
}

This allows the object to behave like an array during iteration.

7. Import / Export Debugging Scenario

Answer - Common mistake
Confusing default exports with named exports leads to undefined imports.

// utils.js
export default function helper() {}

// app.js
import { helper } from "./utils"; 

Correct usage for default export

import helper from "./utils";
Named export example

// utils.js
export function helper() {}

// app.js
import { helper } from "./utils";

Debug checklist
Verify named vs default export usage, check file paths, ensure correct spelling, and log the imported value.

8. Functions vs Classes Decision

Answer - A class is suitable when an object has state and behavior, requires multiple instances, and has a clear lifecycle.
ES6 class structure

class Notification {
  constructor(message) {
    this.message = message;
    this.read = false;
  }

  markAsRead() {
    this.read = true;
  }
}

const note = new Notification("New message");
note.markAsRead();
Classes provide cleaner structure and better scalability for such use cases.


9. Map, Filter, Reduce – Performance Case

Answer - Requirements
Filter completed orders, calculate total revenue, and format the output.

const result = orders
  .filter(order => order.status === "completed")
  .map(order => ({
    id: order.id,
    amount: order.amount
  }))
  .reduce(
    (acc, order) => {
      acc.total += order.amount;
      acc.orders.push(order);
      return acc;
    },
    { total: 0, orders: [] }
  );

Why this approach is better - It is declarative, readable, avoids manual loops, minimizes side effects, and is easier to debug and maintain.

10. Arrow Functions and this Bug

Answer - Problem with normal functions
A regular function has its own this, which depends on how it is called, often leading to undefined in event handlers.

button.onclick = function () {
  console.log(this.name);
};

Arrow function solution
button.onclick = () => {
  console.log(this.name);
};

Why it works - Arrow functions do not have their own this. They lexically bind this from the surrounding scope, ensuring correct context inside class methods and callbacks.
