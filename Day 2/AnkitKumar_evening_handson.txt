1. Difference between DELETE and DROP

DELETE

Removes rows (records) from a table

Table structure remains

Can be rolled back (if transaction is used)

DROP

Removes the entire table

Table structure and data are permanently deleted

Cannot be rolled back

2. Difference between DROP and TRUNCATE

TRUNCATE

Removes all rows from a table

Table structure remains

Faster and uses less memory

DROP

Removes table + data

Table does not exist after drop

Structure must be recreated

3. Explain ACID Properties

Atomicity: Transaction completes fully or not at all

Consistency: Database moves from one valid state to another

Isolation: Transactions do not affect each other

Durability: Data is saved even after system failure

4. How many types of Normalization are there?

1NF: Removes repeating groups

2NF: Removes partial dependency

3NF: Removes transitive dependency

(Higher forms exist, but these three are most important)

5. Fetch the Second Highest Salary

(From Employee table)

SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee);

6. Explain CRUD in DBMS

Create: Insert new data

Read: Retrieve data

Update: Modify existing data

Delete: Remove data

7. What is an Entity Diagram (ER Diagram)?

Graphical representation of database structure

Shows entities, attributes, and relationships

Used in database design

8. How do you describe a Relationship?

Relationship shows how entities are connected

Types: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many

Represented using lines in ER diagram

9. Difference between Primary Key and Unique Key

Primary Key

Uniquely identifies a record

Cannot be NULL

Only one per table

Unique Key

Ensures uniqueness

Can have one NULL value

Multiple unique keys allowed

10. Why do we use NOT NULL?

Ensures column always has a value

Prevents missing or incomplete data

Improves data accuracy
