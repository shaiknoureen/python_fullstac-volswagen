1. Difference between DELETE and DROP.

Answer-

DELETE:

Deletes rows from a table 
Table structure remains
Can use WHERE clause
Can be rolled back (if not committed)
DML command

DROP:

Deletes the entire table  
Table structure is removed
No WHERE clause
Cannot be rolled back     
DDL command

2. Difference between DROP and TRUNCATE.

TRUNCATE

Removes all rows 
Table structure remains
Faster than DELETE
Cannot use WHERE
DDL command

DROP

Removes table completely  
Structure removed 
Faster but destructive   
Not applicable  
DDL command

3. Explain ACID Properties

Atomicity → All or nothing (transaction fully completes or rolls back)
Consistency → Database moves from one valid state to another
Isolation → Transactions don’t interfere with each other
Durability → Once committed, data is permanent even after crash


4. How many types of Normalization are there?

Commonly used normalization forms:

1NF – Atomic values
2NF – No partial dependency
3NF – No transitive dependency
BCNF – Stronger than 3NF
4NF – Removes multi-valued dependency
5NF – Removes join dependency


5. Fetch the Second Highest Salary (Employee & Department)

Using subquery

SELECT e.name, e.salary, d.dept_name FROM employee e JOIN department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id WHERE e.salary = ( SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee) );

6. Explain CRUD in DBMS

CRUD represents basic database operations:

C – Create → Inserts new data in the database.
R – Read → Reads the data present in the database.
U – Update → Updates the existing data with new information.
D – Delete → Deletes/Remove the specified information from the data.


7. What is an Entity Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram)?

A visual representation of database structure

Shows:

Entities (tables) - Represents real world object like employee, course etc.
Attributes (columns) - Describes the properties associated with entities.
Relationships show how entity are related to each other.

8. How do you describe Relationships?

Relationships define how entities are connected:

One-to-One (1:1) One entity relates to one entity
One-to-Many (1:M) One entity relates to multiple entities
Many-to-Many (M:N) Multiple entities relate to multiple entities (resolved using junction table)

9. Difference between Primary Key and Unique Key

Primary Key                                           Unique Key

Uniquely identifies a record                              Ensures uniqueness 
Only one per table                                     Multiple allowed 
Cannot be NULL                                       Can have one NULL 
Used for relationships                                   Not mandatory for relationships

10. Why do we use NOT NULL?

Ensures a column cannot store NULL values
Forces mandatory data
Improves data integrity
Prevents incomplete records

Example: student_id, email
