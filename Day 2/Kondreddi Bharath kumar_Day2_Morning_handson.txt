DBMS (Database Management System):
1.It is a software used to manage data from a database.
2.It is used to perform all kinds of operations such as:
  inserting the data, updating the data, deleting the data, fetching the data  etc.
3.It acts as an intermediary between the user and the database.
4.It is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data.
5.It reduces data redundancy, improves data security, and enhances decision-making 
  through data visualization and reporting.
6.It provides a controlled environment for working with data, ensuring data accuracy 
  and consistency.
7.It allows multiple users to access the database simultaneously without conflicts.
8.DBMS provides data backup and recovery mechanisms to prevent data loss in case of 
  system failures.
9.It ensures data independence, meaning changes in the database structure do not 
  affect application programs.
10.It provides authorization and authentication to restrict unauthorized access to data.


RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):
1.The data is stored in the form of table structures, and these tables can have relationships 
  with each other using keys.
2.It offer robust security features, allowing administrators to control who can access the data.
3.It support SQL (Structured Query Language), which is used for querying and manipulating data.
4.RDBMS platforms are designed to handle large volumes of data and support multiple concurrent users.
5.It provide comprehensive backup and recovery options to protect data from system failures.
6.RDBMS encourages normalization, a process that organizes data to minimize redundancy and 
  ensure efficient storage.
7.Normalized data structures reduce data duplication, making the system more efficient and easy 
  to maintain.
8.RDBMS enforces data integrity using constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique keys, 
  and check constraints.
9.It follows ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure reliable 
  transaction processing.
10.RDBMS provides data consistency even when multiple users access the database simultaneously.
11.It supports indexing, which improves the speed of data retrieval operations.



Library Schema:

In the beginning, the library is small and managed by a single librarian who maintains information 
using separate notebooks and files. One file contains book details, another stores member information, 
and a third keeps records of issued books. Whenever a book is issued, the librarian manually writes 
the same book and member details again in the issue file. Since there is no proper connection between 
these files, the same information is repeated in multiple places. If any detail changes, it must be 
updated everywhere, which often leads to confusion and mistakes. This situation is similar to a DBMS, 
where data is stored and accessed but relationships between data are not well organized, resulting 
in data redundancy and inconsistency.
As the library grows and the number of books and members increases, the librarian shifts to a more 
organized system using a relational database. In this new system, all book information is stored in a 
BOOKS table, where each book is assigned a unique book_id. Member details are stored separately in a 
MEMBERS table, with each member having a unique member_id. When a book is issued, the transaction is 
recorded in an ISSUE_RECORDS table, which stores only the book_id and member_id along with issue and 
return dates. These tables are linked using keys, so the system can easily identify which member has 
borrowed which book without repeating data.
This structured approach represents an RDBMS, where data is stored in tables with clear relationships. 
It eliminates data duplication, makes searching faster, and ensures accuracy and consistency. Thus, 
while the DBMS-style system works for a small library with limited data, the RDBMS-based system 
using BOOKS, MEMBERS, and ISSUE_RECORDS tables is more reliable and suitable as the library grows 
and data accuracy becomes important.



Why is normalization supported only in RDBMS and not in DBMS? Explain using a library schema.

Normalization is supported only in RDBMS because it stores data in tables with keys and relationships, 
which helps remove duplicate data and maintain consistency. DBMS does not support normalization properly 
because it stores data in files without defined relationships, leading to data repetition.

In an RDBMS, data is organized into well-defined tables such as BOOKS, MEMBERS, and ISSUE_RECORDS. 
Each table represents a single entity and uses primary keys to uniquely identify records. Relationships 
between tables are created using foreign keys, which allows data to be split logically across tables. 
For example, book details are stored only once in the BOOKS table, member details only once in the 
MEMBERS table, and the ISSUE_RECORDS table stores only the related IDs. This structure makes it easy 
to apply normalization rules, reduces redundancy, and ensures data consistency.

In contrast, a DBMS stores data in separate files or unstructured formats without enforced relationships. 
In a library DBMS, book and member details may be written repeatedly in multiple files whenever a book is 
issued. Since there are no keys or relational links, dividing data into separate entities is difficult, 
and normalization cannot be applied effectively. As a result, DBMS systems often contain duplicate data 
and inconsistencies.



Which ACID properties are supported in an RDBMS for a library schema, and how are they applied?

In an RDBMS-based library schema, all ACID properties are supported to ensure that book issuing and 
returning operations are reliable and accurate. Atomicity ensures that when a book is issued or returned, 
all related actions—such as updating the book status in the BOOKS table and inserting or updating a record 
in the ISSUE_RECORDS table—are completed together as a single unit; if any step fails, the entire transaction 
is rolled back. Consistency ensures that the database always follows library rules, such as a book not being 
issued to more than one member at the same time and only existing members being allowed to borrow books, which 
is enforced through constraints and relationships between the BOOKS, MEMBERS, and ISSUE_RECORDS tables. 
Isolation ensures that when multiple members try to issue or return books simultaneously, each transaction is 
executed independently without interfering with others, preventing conflicts like double issuance of the same book. 
Finally, Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, the changes—such as issued or returned book 
records—are permanently saved in the database and remain safe even if a system failure occurs. Together, these 
ACID properties make the library schema in an RDBMS secure, consistent, and reliable for multi-user operations.
