1. An online shopping website is facing frequent downtime during sales. How would you apply the SDLC phases to identify and permanently fix this issue?


Answer - 
	
Requirement Analysis

I will try to identify peak-load expectations like traffic spikes, concurrent users.
I will seek clarity for non-functional requirements (availability, scalability etc.).

Design

I will design scalable architecture (load balancers, auto-scaling, caching).
I will try to remove single points of failure.

Implementation

I will try to optimize code, DB queries, async processing.
I will introduce caching and rate-limiting.

Testing

I will perform load testing before sales.

Deployment & Maintenance

Will monitor the system and fix issues quickly.



2. A client wants to launch an MVP of an online food delivery app in 3 months. Which SDLC model would you choose and why?

Answer-
	
I would choose the Agile Model.

Reason:

We can build the app in small parts.
Core features like login, order and payment can be done first.
Client can give feedback easily.
Changes can be handled easily.

Agile is better than all other models in this scenario.


3. After deployment, users report that the payment feature fails intermittently. In which SDLC phase should this have been caught, and how would you prevent it next time?

Answer-

This should have been caught in the testing phase.

Potential reasons - 

May be the Payment gateway was not tested properly and different scenarios like slow internet were not tested.

Next time -

I will do proper integration testing.
I will test payment under load.
I will handle failures properly in code.


4. A business requirement changes midway while developing a subscription-based platform. How does the traditional SDLC handle this, and what are its limitations?

Answer - 

In traditional SDLC (waterfall) model, changes are difficult.

We have to go back to requirement and design again.
It increases time and cost.
Development gets delayed.

This is the limitations of traditional SDLC and this is why Agile is preferred.


5. An online banking application must meet strict security and compliance requirements. How would you incorporate security testing into the SDLC lifecycle?


Answer - 

Security should be added in every SDLC phase.

Requirement: Security roles should be noted clearly.
Design: Planning of authentication and authorization will be done.
Development: By following secure coding practices.
Testing: By doing security and vulnerability testing.
Maintenance: Monitor and fix security issues regularly.

Security checks should not be done at the end.


6. Your team delivered a feature, but it doesn’t match the customer’s expectation. Which SDLC step likely failed, and how would you improve it?


Answer-

The issue is most likely in the requirement gathering phase.

Requirements were not understood properly.
Customer expectations were not clear.

Improvement :

Ask clear questions.
Show demos or sample screens.
Take feedback regularly.



7. A legacy e-commerce system needs to be migrated to a cloud-based architecture. How would SDLC guide this migration process?


Answer-

SDLC guided approach

Requirements

Identify scalability, cost, security goals.

Analysis

Assess legacy system dependencies and risks.

Design

Choosing cloud architecture (microservices, managed DBs).
Planning that data migration strategy.

Implementation

Incremental migration (module-wise).
Use of feature toggles.

Testing 

Regression, performance, security testing.

Deployment

Phased rollout with rollback plan.

Maintenance

Optimize costs, monitor performance, improve reliability.
