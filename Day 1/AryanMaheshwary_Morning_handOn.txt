Ans 1) Apply SDLC by analyzing peak-load issues, Designing a scalable architecture, optimizing code, performing load and stress testing and monitoring the system after deployment to prevent future downtime.

Ans 2) I will choose waterfall model because it is mostly used for smaller projects and easy to develop. More advantages of waterfall model are:
     a) easy to understand
     b) easy to manage

Ans 3) Phase in which it should have been caught would be: Testing Phase and i will perform manual testing after developing some of the parts and debugging will be the main part i will be focusing on in future.

Ans 4) How traditional SDLC will handle it: 
       a) we will be returning to the Requirement Analysis phase 
       b) it will cause us to redesign, redevelopment, and retesting

       Limitations:
       a) high cost
       b) poor flexibility
       c) late customer feedback

Ans 5) Security should be integrated in every SDLC phase through secure requirements, secure coding, and regular audits.

Ans 6) The failure occurred would be in the requirement analysis phase. Improvement requires a clear communication, requirement validation, and customer feedback.

Ans 7) Sdlc guides migration by analyzing the existing system, designing cloud architecture, modifying code, testing thoroughly, and deploying in phases.
